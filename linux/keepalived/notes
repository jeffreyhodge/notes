adding weight to my vrrp process check script broke the failover for the service, need to figure that out

watch for selinux blocking access to cpu (this may not be an issue)

keepalived uses vrrp which has its own protocol (112) and needs to be allowed in the firewall, see allow script
vrrp keepalives are sent out via multicast which generally means you can use any IPs in the same vlan, but if multicast is not allowing sending to all addresses in a vlan you will need to make sure the IPs you use are all in the same multicast group
